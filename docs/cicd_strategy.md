## Overview

This document outlines our deployment strategies for both AWS and self-hosted environments. Each approach is designed to maximize reliability, minimize downtime, and ensure consistent deployments across environments.

## AWS Deployment Strategy

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to manage infrastructure
- Version control all infrastructure definitions
- Maintain separate configurations for staging and production

### 2. Containerization
- Docker containers for application packaging
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for container storage
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for orchestration

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

    C --> D[Create & Push Container]
    D --> E[Deploy]
```

#### Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          make test
          make build
      - name: Push to ECR
        run: |
          aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}
          docker push ${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}/app:${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Deploy to ECS
        run: |
          aws ecs update-service --cluster production --service app --force-new-deployment
```

#### Pipeline Steps:
1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. Run tests and security scans in GitHub-hosted runner
3. Build Docker image
4. Push to ECR using AWS credentials
5. Update ECS task definition/K8s deployment
6. Monitor deployment status

### 4. Blue-Green Deployment
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Route traffic using Route 53 or Application Load Balancer
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Easy rollback capability

## Self-Hosted Deployment Strategy

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- GitLab Runner or Jenkins for CI/CD

### 2. Deployment Process with GitHub Actions
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Git Push] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[Build & Test]
    C --> D[Docker Build]
    D --> E[Deploy via SSH]
```

#### GitHub Actions Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/self-hosted.yml
name: Deploy to Self-Hosted
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          make test
          make build
      - name: Deploy to server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd /app
            docker-compose pull
            docker-compose up -d
```

#### Steps:
1. Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
2. SSH-based deployment using secure keys
3. Docker Compose for service orchestration
4. Health checks before switching traffic
5. Automated backup before deployment

### 3. Rolling Updates
- Update services one at a time
- Health check verification
- Automatic rollback on failure

## Recommended Approaches

### For AWS (Recommended)
We recommend the following strategy for AWS deployments:

1. **ECS with Fargate**
   - Serverless container management
   - Automatic scaling
   - Cost-effective for variable loads
   - Simplified infrastructure management

2. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Zero downtime deployments
   - Simple rollback process
   - Production-grade reliability

### For Self-Hosted (Recommended)
For self-hosted environments, we recommend:

1. **Docker Compose with Traefik**
   - Easy service orchestration
   - Automatic SSL management
   - Simple reverse proxy configuration
   - Built-in load balancing

2. **Rolling Updates with Health Checks**
   - Minimal downtime
   - Controlled deployment process
   - Automatic failure detection

## Security Considerations

### AWS
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Implement IAM roles with least privilege
- Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- Regular security audits

### Self-Hosted
- Use Vault for secrets management
- Implement fail2ban for intrusion prevention
- Regular security updates
- Automated backup system

## Monitoring and Logging

### AWS
- CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- X-Ray for distributed tracing
- SNS for alerts and notifications

### Self-Hosted
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK Stack for log management

## Disaster Recovery

### AWS
- Multi-region backup strategy
- Automated snapshots
- Documented recovery procedures

### Self-Hosted
- Regular backups to off-site storage
- Documented recovery procedures

### When to Choose AWS
- Startups needing quick deployment
- Projects requiring rapid scaling
- Applications with variable load
- Teams with limited DevOps resources
- Compliance-heavy applications
- Global application deployment

### When to Choose Self-Hosted
- Cost-sensitive long-term projects
- Applications with stable, predictable load
- Projects requiring full infrastructure control
- Data privacy-critical applications
- Teams with strong DevOps expertise
- Applications with specific hardware requirements

## Conclusion

For most projects, we strongly recommend the AWS deployment strategy using ECS/Fargate with blue-green deployment. This approach provides:

- Minimal operational overhead
- Excellent scalability
- Built-in high availability
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Simplified disaster recovery

However, for projects with specific requirements or budget constraints, our self-hosted strategy using Docker Compose and Traefik provides a robust and cost-effective alternative.

Remember to regularly review and update these deployment strategies as new tools and best practices emerge.
